# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Chloropleth Map
The project contains various ways to access a covid chloropleth map with appropriate details:
1. Free public facing map with details on the total confirmed cases as per country selected.
2. Subscription based map with more details than the public map on the effects sustained by the selected country.

The maps are constructed using Plotly which provides python a graphic interactive library which provided useful tools for plotting out the covid data.
The covid dataset is extracted from kaggle.com because it provided country details that could be used to map out in plotly.
The global map is mapped out according to the total number of confirmed cases, thus the colour scheme is also based on it. 

## How to access the map
Accessing the chlorpleth map is quite a simple process, the user can click on the button provided on the webpage, which will then execute the script that dislplays the appropriate map to the user according to the type of user they are (public or subscription).

## How to use the heat map
The user has to hover over the preferred country they seek to get details about, then a pop up box with the relevant infomation will appear.
For the public user the pop box will only display the country name and confirmed cases.
Whilst the subscription user the pop up box will display more details such as country name, total confirm cases, total deaths, new cases, new deaths and region which the country is in.
